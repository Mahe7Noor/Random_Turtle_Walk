# 🐢 Turtle Random Walk

A simple Python script using the `turtle` module to simulate a random walk using a turtle object.

## 📸 Preview

This program makes a turtle draw a random path by changing its heading in one of the four cardinal directions.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The turtle moves forward 10 pixels.
- It randomly changes direction to 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
- This is repeated 200 times to create a random walk effect.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x

This script uses the standard library, so no external packages are required.

## ▶️ How to Run

Clone this repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-random-walk.git
cd turtle-random-walk
python turtle_random_walk.py
